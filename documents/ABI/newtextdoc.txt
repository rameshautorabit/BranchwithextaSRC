You can deploy or retrieve up to 10,000 files at once and the maximum size of the deployed or retrieved .zip file is 39 MB. Note the following:

If using the Force.com Migration Tool to deploy an unzipped folder, all files in the folder are compressed first. The maximum size of uncompressed components in an unzipped folder is 400 MB or less depending on the compression ratio. If the files have a high compression ratio, you can migrate a total of approximately 400 MB because the compressed size would be under 39 MB. However, if the components can't be compressed much, like binary static resources, you can migrate less than 400 MB.
Metadata API base-64 encodes components after theyâ€™re compressed. The resulting .zip file can't exceed 50 MB, which is the limit for SOAP messages. Base-64 encoding increases the size of the payload, so your compressed payload can't exceed approximately 39 MB before encoding.
